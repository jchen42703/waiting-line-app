# App Design

## Stuff I missed

In admin sidebar:

- highlight which queue is currently selected

In Admin dashboard 1 (selected queue)

- Date queue was created
- add average time user is in queue
- Additional analytics
  - Total number of users who joined queue in past X hours
  - Total number of users who passed queue in past X hours

In Admin dashboard 2 (users in queue)

- Down the line
  - Edit registration information
  - Would need to give users the ability to change when in line
